## Scope

RNA-seq, as a technique, can be a broad topic. 

In this workshop, we will specifically cover using bulk **short read** 'next-generation' sequencing data for **differential expression analysis**, 
with a focus on using **web-based tools** and understanding **how design experiments** and **interpret quality metrics**.

The goal is that for many typical experimental designs, particpants will learn to more confidently approach their own data in order to process it 
from raw reads to a differential expression analysis.

In this workshop, we explicitly ***don't*** cover:

- Runnning pipelines and analysing data using the commandline, R, Python etc.
- *De novo* assembly of transcriptomes
- microRNAs (miRNAs), other small RNAs
- Long read technologies
- Single cell and spatial RNA-seq
- Discovering novel transcripts / splice variants
- Variant calling (SNPs) from RNA-seq data
