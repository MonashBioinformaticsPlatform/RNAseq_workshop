## Summary

This workshop is aimed at researchers who are looking to design, analyze, and interpret bulk RNA-seq experiments without the need for coding. It is particularly suitable for those who want to:

- Develop a strong understanding of RNA-seq experiment planning and data analysis.
- Use web-based tools to process and interpret RNA-seq data.
- Gain confidence in making informed decisions about experimental design and data interpretation.
